# Data Structure & Algorithm in Python

## What is a Data Structure?
- **Data Structure** are different ways of organizing data on your computer, that can be used effectively.

## What is an Algorithm?
- Set of instructions to perform a **task**. 
- What makes a good algorithm?
  - Correctness
  - Efficiency

## Why are Data Structures and Algorithm important?
- Efficiency
- Organization
- Problem Solving
- Scalability
- Foundation for advance topics
- Job readiness

## Types of Data Structure
- Primitive 
  - Simple
  - Fixed Size
  - Smaller
  - Simple Operations
  - Represented as simple values in Memory
  - Types:
    - Integer
    - Float
    - String
    - Boolean
- Non-Primitive
  - Complex (can be composed of multiple primitive data types)
  - Dynamic Size 
  - Larger (can grow and shrink dynamically)
  - Complex operation (e.g Data Manipulation or sorting)
  - Represented in memory as pointers to other memory location
  - Category:
    - Linear
      - Arranged in Sequential Order
      - Connected with each adjacent element
      - Used to represent sequence of data where order is important
      - Types:
        - List (Built-in)
        - Tuple (Built-in)
        - Array
        - Linked List
        - Stack
        - Queue
    - Non-Linear
      - Not in sequential order
      - Have hierarchical relation between elements
      - Types:
        - Set (Built-in)
        - Dictionary (Built-in)
        - Tree
        - Graph

## Types of Algorithms
- Sorting
  - To sort data in ascending or descending
  - i.e bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort and heap sort, etc.
- Searching
  - To find a specific value in a data set
  - i.e linear search and binary search, etc
- Graph
  - To work with data that can be represented as a graph
  - i.e breadth-first search and depth-first search, etc.
- Dynamic Programming
  - To solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems
- Divide and Conquer:
  - To solve problem by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-problem independently, and then combining the results.
  - i.e merge sort and quick sort, etc.
- Recursive
  - To solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems that are similar in nature
