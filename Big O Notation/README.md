# What is Big O?
Big O is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms.

> `Time Complexity`: A way of showing how the runtime of a function increases as the size of input increases
> - In time complexity, we don't measure how much time it took to run a program, as the slower program will run much faster on a super fast computer,
>   So, we measure the `number of operations`

> `Space Complexity`: the amount of memory required by an algorithm to solve a problem, which is influenced by the population size and problem dimension.

### Types of Runtime:
- O(N)
- O($N^2$)
- O($2^N$)
- Time Complexity: O(wh)

## Big O Notations
- Best Case
- Average Case
- Worst Case

> Big O: It is a complexity that is going to be less or equal to the worst case <br>
> Big - &Omega; It is a complexity that is going to be at least more than the best case <br>
> Big - &Theta;: It is a complexity that is within bounds of the worst and the best cases.
